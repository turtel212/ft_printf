# Ft_printf
## About the project
This is a *42 school* project, the goal of this project is to develop our own **printf** function. The printf or print format function writes the C string pointed by format to the standard output (stdout). If format includes format specifiers (subsequences beginning with %), the additional arguments following format are formatted and inserted in the resulting string replacing their respective specifiers.

## Knowledge
Thanks to this project we are able to:
1. Know how the **varidic functions** work.
2. Develop format conversion functions.
3. Dinamic memory management.
4. Compile our own libraries on our projects.

## Used languages
- C
- Makefile
